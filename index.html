					<h2>A bit about me</h2>
					<p>Although I specialize in front end web development, I continue to progress and develop a number of other skills in back-end and C# development.</p>
					<p>I strive for clean, readable code, that is both cross-platform compatible as well as performance optimized.  My development skills include <span>HTML5</span>, <span>CSS3</span>, <span>Javascript</span>, <span>jQuery</span>, <span>PHP</span>, <span>Wordpress</span>, <span>Bootstrap</span>, and <span>Foundation</span>. This site was built using a minimum amount of pure HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript.</p>
          <p>Through a combination of commercial experience, University studies and self-teaching, I have also established practical skills in problem solving and being able to think in a clear, logical way to resolve issues.  I have learnt to work independently to develop new ideas and overcome challenges as well as within a team, utilising each team memberâ€™s strengths in order to form an idea or complete a task quickly and efficiently.  I am currently seeking a junior developer role which will offer the opportunity to further develop my skills while working within a team to create the best possible end products for clients.</p>
          <p>Through my background in hospitality and customer service I have learned the importance of great communication skills, professionalism and teamwork, which I apply to every project I work on.</p>
